# Mushroom Classification

The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms contains descriptions
of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the
Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). Each species is labelled as either
definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or maybe edible but not recommended. This last
category was merged with the toxic category. The Guide asserts unequivocally that
there is no simple rule for judging a mushroom's edibility, such as "leaflets three, leave it
be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
The main goal is to predict which mushroom is poisonous & which is edible.

# Dataset

Dataset Link: - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
